# MatlabUtils

Some common functions I use for matlab stuff, so that I don't have to re-make or move them around.

Include them by either making or adding to userpath/startup.m the following
```matlab
addpath('path/to/utils');
```

Running the *setup_utils.m* script should get the path added to the startup script
```matlab
setup_utils
```
